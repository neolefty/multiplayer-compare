# Supabase Quickstart

Based on this [Supabase](https://supabase.com/docs) tutorial, but *less pretty*: [React Quickstart](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/tutorials/with-react).

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/). Use `yarn start`, `yarn build`, etc.
